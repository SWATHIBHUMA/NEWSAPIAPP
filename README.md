# NEWSAPIAPP
I have developed a basic front-end web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing my web development skills. This project highlights my ability to retrieve data from an API website, leveraging API keys for access. Furthermore, I've integrated user-friendly features, including a mode-switching option that allows users to switch between light and dark modes, along with smooth transition effects for an enhanced user experience. This project serves as a simple yet functional web application, demonstrating my expertise in web development and user interface design.
